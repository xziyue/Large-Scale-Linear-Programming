This project is part of my final paper, which I am rushing to finish at the moment. Basically, it it designed to run revised simplex method on large matrices. The coef matrix is to be stored on the hard drive, and sparse matrix is used, so that we can calculate larger matrices with limited RAM. (matrix class courtesy of Eigen - http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
Again, as it is a product of rushing work, some part could have been designed better, especially the repeated calculation of vectors in the process of solving.
